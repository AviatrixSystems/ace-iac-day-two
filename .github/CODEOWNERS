# When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews,

# this repository, with the Development group able to author and push pull requests.

# In a true org structure, this line would be something like: "app-fqdn-rules.tf @<secops>"
app-fqdn-rules.tf @emhemedmohannad

# In a true org structure, these files should have the Network Operators account as the owner:
